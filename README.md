# Exercise 7: K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis
In this exercise, you will implement the K-means clustering algorithm and
apply it to compress an image. In the second part, you will use principal
component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.
Before starting on the programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching 
the video lectures and completing the review questions for the associated
topics.
<br />
To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the starter
code and unzip its contents to the directory where you wish to complete the
exercise. If needed, use the cd command in Octave/MATLAB to change to
this directory before starting this exercise.
<br />
You can also find instructions for installing Octave/MATLAB in the 
Environment Setup Instructions" of the course website.
